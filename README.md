# 6D-Symbols-Colours-Shades-Complexity
6D Symbols (1114111), Colours, Shades, Complexity


This updated code includes the LatticeSymbol struct, which contains the symbol (Unicode code point), color, shade, and complexity properties. The createLattice function now assigns random values to these properties for each lattice node. The encryptMessageWithDiffusion and decryptMessageWithDiffusion functions now work with the symbol property of the lattice nodes.

Feel free to modify the code according to your needs and customize the symbols, colors, shades, and complexity values as desired.
